# WordZ: Language Learning Form App
This is a simple web application that allows you to learn new words in a foreign language by making a wordlist. The application requires you to enter a word in the language you are trying to learn, along with its translation in your native language.

## Installation
To use this app, simply download the source code and run it on a web server. The app requires a web server with PHP support.

1. git clone
2. cd angular_wordz
3. yarn install
4. ng serve
5. new terminal
6. cd laravel_wordz
7. composer install
8. php artisan migrate

## Usage
To get started with the app, open the form in your web browser and select the language you want to learn from the dropdown menu. Then, enter a word in the foreign language and its translation in your native language. Click on the "Submit" button to submit the form.

The app will store the word and its translation in a database and show you a confirmation message. You can then use the "Next Word" button to get a new word to translate. The app will keep track of the words you have learned and will not show them to you again.
